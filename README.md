# Adaptive-Line-Enhancer
An Adaptive Line Enhancer (ALE) is a digital signal processing technique used to enhance or extract a specific signal from a noisy environment, particularly when the frequency of the desired signal is unknown. It's a powerful tool in applications like communications, radar, and speech processing.
Basic Principle:
1. Filtering and Adaptation: ALEs are based on the concept of adaptive filtering. An adaptive filter adjusts its parameters based on the input data to minimize the error between the desired output and the actual output.
2. LMS Algorithm: The Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm is commonly used in ALE. It's a type of gradient descent algorithm that iteratively adjusts filter coefficients to minimize the mean square error between the filter output and the desired signal.
