# Adaptive-Line-Enhancer
An Adaptive Line Enhancer (ALE) is a digital signal processing technique used to enhance or extract a specific signal from a noisy environment, particularly when the frequency of the desired signal is unknown. It's a powerful tool in applications like communications, radar, and speech processing.
Basic Principle:
1. Filtering and Adaptation: ALEs are based on the concept of adaptive filtering. An adaptive filter adjusts its parameters based on the input data to minimize the error between the desired output and the actual output.
2. LMS Algorithm: The Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm is commonly used in ALE. It's a type of gradient descent algorithm that iteratively adjusts filter coefficients to minimize the mean square error between the filter output and the desired signal.
Components of an ALE:
1. Input Signal (x[n]): The input signal to the ALE is a mixture of the desired signal and noise. It's represented as x[n], where 'n' is the discrete time index.
2. Adaptive Filter: The core of the ALE is an adaptive filter. This filter has adjustable coefficients that are updated iteratively to minimize the error. The filter is represented by the transfer function H(z).
3. Reference Input (d[n]): This is the reference signal, which is assumed to contain only the noise. In practice, it's obtained by passing the input signal through a delay element.
4. Error Signal (e[n]): The error signal represents the discrepancy between the actual output of the filter and the reference input. It's calculated as e[n] = x[n] - d[n].
Operation of an ALE:
1. Initialization: Initially, the filter coefficients are set to arbitrary values.
2. Adaptation Process: The LMS algorithm updates the filter coefficients iteratively to minimize the mean square error. This is done using the formula:
  			W(k+1) = W(k) + μ * e(n) * X(n)
where W(k) is the filter coefficient vector at iteration 'k', μ is the step size (a small positive constant), e(n) is the error signal, and X(n) is the input signal vector.
3. Filtered Output (y[n]): The filter processes the input signal, producing an output y[n] = H(z) * x[n], which ideally contains only the desired signal.
4. Updated Reference (d[n]): The reference signal is continuously updated using the delayed version of the filtered output, which helps to adapt to changes in the input signal.
